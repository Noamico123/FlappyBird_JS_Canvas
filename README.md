# FlappyBird_JS_Canvas

In order to run this program you need to install Liveserver to your VSCode and initialize it.

Tools I used:
Sprite â€“ one image combining all the images that will display on the program. 
The idea is to take specific coordinates for every use in canvas while updating it.
I used few tools in order to create a sprite PNG file and to get the coordinates of each element.
